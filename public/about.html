<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>Hi, I'm Javier. A native Texan, a father, tech enthusiast and as of recently I'm also becoming a self-taught developer. I have been working on/off in IT since the age of 18, now 31, I am attempting to shift not only my focus but career as well.</p>

<p>”Why now?” you might ask. Admittedly, I've taken far too long to realize what I would like to do in life and when I take the time to think about it, programming is the odd shaped puzzle piece that's been missing for quite some time. It takes my love for tech and satisfies my inner tinkerer simultaneously, a win in my book. </p>
