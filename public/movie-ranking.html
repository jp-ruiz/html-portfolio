<h1>Some of my favorite films by Javier Ruiz</h1>
<h2>In no particualr order, these films deserve more than a single watch.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<P>Get ready for the water works. As a parent this will pluck away at my emotional strings and is overall an expirience.</P>
<h3>Transformers</h3>
<P>This one is easy. Directed by Michael Bay, you know there will be explisions and great sfx. I also personally think Shia LaBeouf knocked it out of the park as the main character. </P>
<h3>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</h3>
<P>What's not to love here. Great animation, great soundtrack, vibrant colors, action and some comedy. </P>
